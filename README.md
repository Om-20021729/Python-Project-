# **Guess the Number Game** ðŸŽ¯  

## **Project Overview**  
"Guess the Number" is a simple Python-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. The game provides hints (higher/lower) after each guess to guide the player toward the correct number.  

## **Features**  
- Random number generation within a predefined range (e.g., 1-100).  
- User input to guess the number.  
- Feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.  
- A counter to track the number of attempts.  
- Option to play again after winning or quitting.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** for scripting.  
- **Random module** to generate the secret number.  
- **Loop structures** for repeated guessing attempts.  
- **Conditional statements** to evaluate the guess and provide feedback.  

## **How It Works**  
1. The program generates a random number.  
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.  
3. The program provides hints (higher/lower).  
4. The process repeats until the user guesses correctly.  
5. The total number of attempts is displayed, and the player can choose to play again.  

This project is a great introduction to Python for beginners, focusing on loops, conditionals, and user interaction! ðŸš€
